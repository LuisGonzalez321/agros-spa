          <strong>In the heart of rural Central America</strong> lives a

          from the cycle of extreme poverty that had de ned
          their lives for generations.
          is is the story of Victor Aguilar, his wife Sadia,
          and their three children, in their journey to
          enduring prosperity.

        his own land, as well as providing a decent home for his family, Victor found a <br>
        comprehensive solution to his needs through Agros. <br><br>

        Over the years, the program provided him with access to agricultural land, decent <br>
        housing, basic services, technical assistance, ongoing productive training, and access <br>
        to formal markets. <br><br>

        From adversity to success: Victor's participation in Agros has resulted in a remarkable <br>
        transformation. Over the years, his agricultural production has seen consistent <br>
        success, leading to a signi cant improvement in his income. <br> <br>

        Now, the family of ve lives in their own home, they’ve paid o their land loan, and <br>
        Sadia looks forward to starting her own business. Victor is an agriculture <br>
        businessman, a skilled producer who manages the farm, and saves for the future. <br>
